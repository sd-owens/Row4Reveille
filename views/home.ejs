                                    Help us raise funds for <a href="http://thereveilleproject.org">The Reveille Project (TRP)</a>. This amazing organization helps disabled veterans transition from active duty to civilian life. TRP veterans receive scholarships to local CrossFit affiliates, nutrition counseling and access to a community that supports them on a social, emotional and spiritual level.

                                    The format of the event is brutally simple. Row as hard as you can for 10 minutes, rest for 50 minutes, repeat for 24 hours. Prizes will be awarded to the male and female who row the most cumulative meters. Additional prizes will be given out during incentive rounds, known as Primes, throughout the event. THIS IS NOT A TEAM EVENT. INDIVIDUALS ONLY.
                                </p>
